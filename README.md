## User manual

### Quick start

1. Tweak the **Settings** (right pane) or hit **Randomize all**.
2. Press **Render** (or `R`). A progress bar shows long renders.
3. **Download** a single file, or **Export maps (.zip)** for a bundle of
   height / normal / color / AO maps.
4. **Copy URL** to share — the link reproduces the exact same image on any
   machine (generation is fully deterministic).

### Layout

- **Canvas** (top left) — the rendered map, always the largest square that fits.
  **Mouse-wheel** zooms (1–8×), **drag** pans while zoomed, **double-click**
  resets.
- **Output** (below the canvas, scrolls) — resolution, bit depth, inversion,
  and one card per map.
- **Settings** (right, scrolls) — the pattern generators. Groups toggle on/off
  (disabled groups collapse to their header), each has its own **Randomize**,
  and the 🔒 next to a parameter excludes it from randomization. Slider values
  can be **clicked and typed** for exact numbers.

### Output options

- **Resolution** — 1024² to 8192². Changing it resets the canvas. Thanks to
  determinism you can tune at low resolution, then re-render the same seed at
  high resolution.
- **Bit depth** (single-file Download) —
  **8-bit** PNG (the canvas as displayed, including preview/inversion),
  **16-bit** grayscale PNG (full-precision height map, no banding),
  **32-bit float** OpenEXR (lossless float height, for Blender/Nuke/World
  Machine).
- **Seamless Texture** (in Settings → Basics) — makes the height map tile, and
  every derived map (normal, AO) tiles with it.

### Maps

Each card in the Output pane controls one exportable map:

| Map                   | What it is                                   | Controls                                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Height**            | The displacement map itself (grayscale)      | Depth follows the global bit-depth selector |
| **Normal**            | Tangent-space normals (3×3 Sobel, OpenGL/+Y) | Strength slider; 8- or 16-bit RGB           |
| **Color**             | Height→color via a gradient LUT              | Gradient editor (below); 8-bit RGB          |
| **Ambient occlusion** | HBAO from the height field                   | Radius + strength; off by default (costly)  |

Every map can be **previewed** on the canvas (toggle back to the original
before switching) and included/excluded from the zip export. Previews and
exports use the same math — what you see is what you export.

**Gradient editor** (Color card): **drag** stops to reposition, **click the
bar** to add a stop, select a stop to recolor or delete it, **Randomize** for
new colors. Custom gradients are part of the shareable URL.

### Export maps (.zip)

**Export options…** (`E`) opens the export dialog: a shared **base name** plus
a per-map **prefix/suffix** (e.g. `_N` for normal, `_C` for color) with a live
filename preview, per-map include checkboxes, and the normal map's bit depth.
Files are named `{prefix}{base}{suffix}.png` inside `{base}.zip`. The plain
**Export maps (.zip)** button exports one-click with the current options.

### Keyboard shortcuts

`R` render · `E` export options · `1/2/3` toggle normal/color/AO preview ·
`?` cheatsheet · `Esc` close dialog.

## Feature parity with Displacement X

Everything Displacement X (v0.5.0) does, Displacement Y does too — same
generators, same look. The differences are additions and internals:

The rendering baseline differs from Displacement X by design: the float core
computes exact values instead of accumulating 8-bit rounding, so images are
cleaner but not byte-identical to the original app's output.

## FAQ

### What is it used for?

Generated height maps and normal maps can be used in 3D software or game engine, such as Houdini, Blender, Unreal, Unity etc.

### Why not just work on `Displacement X`? Why the fork and name change?

1. I don't want to go through the whole pull request process. I just want to make some changes for my own need.
2. All the changes are coded by AI and I don't want to "taint" the original code base.

### Any future plans for `Displacement Y`?

There are several features planned, such as custom sprite packs and more derived maps (roughness / specular / metalness), but no promises.

### I want to share my work done with the help of `Displacement Y`. Where can I do that?

I don't have anything setup yet, but feel free to link or attribute this repo or [displacementy.pages.dev](https://displacementy.pages.dev/).
